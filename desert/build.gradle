// In this section you declare where to find the dependencies of your project
repositories {
    // Use 'jcenter' for resolving your dependencies.
    // You can declare any Maven/Ivy/file repository here.
    // jcenter()

    // !!! I commented out the jcenter and added mavelCentral
    mavenCentral()
}




// In this section you declare the dependencies for your production and test code
dependencies {

    // The production code uses the SLF4J logging API at compile time
    // !!! no sure about this, AND THIS I THINK INCLUDES GSON LIBRARY which we do NOT need!
    // ... so COMMNETED OUT:
    // compile 'org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.21'

    // adding the following:

    // More information: http://square.github.io/okhttp/
    compile 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.4.2'
    // From lecturer email
    compile 'org.json:json:20160810'

    // Declare the dependency for your favourite test framework you want to use in your tests.
    // TestNG is also supported by the Gradle Test task. Just change the
    // testCompile dependency to testCompile 'org.testng:testng:6.8.1' and add
    // 'test.useTestNG()' to your build script.
    testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
